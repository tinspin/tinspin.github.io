Considering using github pages for patch data.
The big concern is the 100GB/month limit.
Antiviruses block HTTP and I really don't want to host my own HTTPS.
Thinking I can download patch data over TCP instead.
But that will also get blocked.
I guess yolo HTTP it is?
Edit: I know HTTP first, then fallback to HTTPS here!?
